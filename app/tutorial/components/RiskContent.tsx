          Risk Limiting Audits (RLAs) are a statistical method used to verify
          the accuracy of election results. The goal of an RLA is to gradually
          reduce the risk of confirming an incorrect election outcome by
          randomly sampling paper ballots. The RAIRE system supports the RLA
          process for Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) elections by generating
          assertions that help ensure the audit process is credible.

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The primary objective of an RLA is to confirm the reported election
          outcome with a maximum risk limit. Auditors randomly sample paper
          ballots and compare them with Cast Vote Records (CVRs). If the sampled
          ballots show no significant discrepancies, the audit can stop,
          assuming the reported result is correct. If discrepancies are found,
          the sample size may be increased, or a full hand recount may be
          conducted.

            <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
              <li>
                Election administrators must commit to a ballot manifest and a
                Cast Vote Record (CVR) for each ballot. A CVR is an electronic
                record of each voter’s choices, which allows auditors to check
                for discrepancies between the electronic records and the paper
                ballots.

            Generate a Random Seed:
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
              <li>
                The ballots to be sampled are selected randomly using a random
                seed generated through a verifiable public process, such as
                rolling dice. This ensures transparency in the selection
                process.

            Estimate the Required Sample Size:
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
              <li>
                The sample size is determined by the margin between the winner
                and loser, the risk limit, and the expected number of errors.
                Closer margins require larger sample sizes to achieve the same
                level of confidence.

            </ul>
          </li>

            Compare the Ballots to the CVRs:
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
              <li>
                The sampled ballots are compared to their corresponding CVRs.
                Discrepancies can either overstate (advantage the reported
                winner) or understate (advantage the reported loser) the
                winner&apos;s margin.

            Calculate Risk and Decide Whether to Continue:
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
              <li>
                The level of risk is calculated based on the discrepancies found
                in the sample. If the risk is within acceptable limits, the
                audit can stop. If not, auditors may either increase the sample
                size or conduct a full hand count.

          Understanding Margin and Difficulty in RLAs
        </h3>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Margin and difficulty are two critical factors that affect the scope
          of an RLA:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 text-gray-700 text-lg space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Margin</strong> refers to the difference between the
            apparent winner’s tally and the apparent loser’s tally. In a
            plurality election, this is simply the number of votes by which the
            winner leads the loser. The smaller the margin, the more ballots
            need to be audited, as closer results are more likely to require
            additional verification.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Difficulty</strong> increases with smaller margins or larger
            discrepancies. When the margin is small, the audit becomes more
            challenging because a small number of errors could potentially alter
            the outcome. Additionally, IRV elections may involve verifying
            multiple elimination steps, which adds to the audit’s complexity.

      <div className="mb-8" data-content="Example">
        <h4 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Example</h4>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Suppose Diego is the reported winner and Chuan is a reported loser in
          a plurality contest.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 text-gray-700 text-lg space-y-2">
          <li>
            If the CVR records a vote for Diego but the ballot paper has a vote
            for Chuan, that is a discrepancy of 2, i.e. a 2-vote overstatement.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the CVR records an invalid vote, but the ballot paper has a vote
            for Chuan, that is a discrepancy of 1, i.e. a 1-vote overstatement.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the CVR and the ballot paper are identical, that is a discrepancy
            of 0.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the CVR records an invalid vote, but the ballot paper has a vote
            for Diego, that is a discrepancy of -1, a 1-vote understatement.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the CVR records a vote for Chuan but the ballot paper has a vote
            for Diego, that is a discrepancy of -2, i.e. a 2-vote
            understatement.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-4">
          Obviously overstatements are far more important than
          understatements—if there are enough overstatements, the apparent
          winner may be wrong.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-4">
          The discrepancies for all the sampled ballots are input into a risk
          measuring function. If the measured risk is less than the Risk Limit
          α, the audit can stop and accept the announced election result.
