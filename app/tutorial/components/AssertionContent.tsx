          In IRV elections, assertions are critical conditions used to verify
          that the announced winner truly won the election. Assertions allow us
          to narrow down the key elimination steps that need to be checked,
          rather than verifying every elimination order. There are two main
          types of assertions used in RAIRE: Not Eliminated Before (NEB)
          Assertions and Not Eliminated Next (NEN) Assertions.

        </h3>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          A Not Eliminated Before (NEB) assertion is a condition that states one
          candidate cannot be eliminated before another. This assertion allows
          us to focus on specific elimination orders and disregard paths that
          don’t affect the outcome.{" "}
          <strong>
            <em>Alice NEB Bob </em>
          </strong>{" "}
          is an assertion saying that Alice cannot be eliminated before Bob,
          irrespective of which other candidates are continuing. In other words,
          no outcome is possible in which Alice is eliminated before Bob.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          When expressed as a comparison of tallies, this assertion says that
          the smallest number of votes Alice can have, at any point in counting,
          is greater than the largest number of votes Bob can ever have while
          Alice is continuing. Alice’s smallest tally is equal to her first
          preference count – the number of ballots on which she is ranked first.
          The largest number of votes Bob can have while Alice is continuing is
          the number of ballots on which he is ranked higher than Alice, or he
          is ranked and Alice is not.

          <strong>
            <em>Alice NEB Bob</em>
          </strong>{" "}
          is true because Bob is ranked a total of 80 times without being
          preceded by Alice, which is less than Alice’s first-preference tally
          of 100. However,{" "}
          <strong>
            <em>Alice NEB Diego</em>
          </strong>{" "}
          is not true, because Diego is ranked 125 times without being preceded
          by Alice, which is more than Alice’s first preference tally.

          NEN assertions compare the tallies of two candidates under the
          assumption that a specific set of candidates have been eliminated. An
          instance of this kind of assertion could look like this:{" "}
          <strong>
            <em>
              NEN: Alice &gt; Bob if only {`{`}Alice, Bob, Diego{`}`}
            </em>
          </strong>{" "}
          remain. This means that in the context where Chuan has been
          eliminated, Alice cannot be eliminated next, because Bob has a lower
          tally. When expressed as a comparison of tallies, this assertion says
          that the number of ballots in Alice’s tally pile, in the context where
          only Alice, Bob, and Diego are continuing, is greater than the number
          of ballots in Bob’s tally pile in this context.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-4">
          This example assumes one eliminated candidate – Chuan – however, NEN
          assertions can be constructed with contexts involving no eliminated
          candidates, or more than one eliminated candidate. The assertion{" "}
          <strong>
            <em>
              NEN: Alice &gt; Chuan if only {`{`}Alice, Bob, Chuan, Diego{`}`}
            </em>
          </strong>{" "}
          remain says that Alice cannot be the first eliminated candidate, as
          she has more votes than Chuan when no candidates have yet been
          eliminated. The assertion{" "}
          <strong>
            <em>
              NEN: Diego &gt; Bob if only {`{`}Bob, Diego{`}`}
            </em>
          </strong>{" "}
          remain says that Diego has more votes than Bob in the context where
          those two are the only continuing candidates.

          Simple assertions sometimes work
        </h3>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
          RAIRE works by generating a set of assertions which, together, imply a
          particular winner. In this section, we introduce some common patterns
          that those sets of assertions might use. We aim to make it obvious why
          certain sets of assertions are enough to imply a particular winner,
          and to match a person’s intuition about why a certain candidate won an
          IRV election.

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
          Sometimes one candidate happens to be so strongly ahead of all the
          others that NEB assertions hold with all other candidates.

          Now suppose there are two candidates who accumulate most of the votes:
          Alice and Bob.
        </p>
        <h5 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-4">Example</h5>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Suppose{" "}
          <strong>
            <em>Alice NEB Bob</em>
          </strong>{" "}
          is not true, but the following weaker fact is true:
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg font-bold italic mb-4">
          <strong>
            <em>

            </em>
          </strong>{" "}
          remain.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          This says that, after Chuan and Diego are eliminated, Alice’s tally is
          higher than Bob’s.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Assume we still have two NEB assertions:
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg font-bold">
          <strong>
            <em>Alice NEB Chuan</em>

          <strong>
            <em>Alice NEB Diego.</em>
          </strong>
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-4">
          This, again, is enough to prove that Alice won. To see why, consider
          the last elimination step. Alice must reach this step, because she
          cannot have been eliminated before Chuan or Diego. If Chuan or Diego
          is the other remaining candidate, Alice beats them (by the NEB
          assertion). The only other possibility is Bob—for this case, the NEN
          assertion shows that, in the last round, Alice beats Bob.

          is enough to disprove every elimination order in which Alice is
          eliminated before Chuan, and hence to disprove the entire tree in
          which Chuan wins. It also allows us to disprove the orders in Bob’s
          tree and Diego’s tree in which Alice is eliminated before Chuan.

          in Bob’s tree and Chuan’s tree are shown below. It still allows the
          possibility that Bob might win via elimination orders Diego, Chuan,
