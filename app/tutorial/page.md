# Getting Started

## Welcome

Welcome to the Audit Visualiser! By the time you&apos;ve completed
this tutorial, you&apos;ll be at least somewhat comfortable with the
fundamental principles of the AuditVisualiser and how to go about
using it.

## What&apos;s Here

This document is designed to be an extremely gentle introduction, so
we included a fair amount of material that may already be very
familiar to you. To keep things simple, we also left out some
information intermediate and advanced users will probably want.

## Ready?

Let&apos;s go!
