# IRV elections and Visualising Outcomes

Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) is a preferential voting system where voters
rank candidates in order of preference. If no candidate receives a
majority of first-preference votes, the candidate with the fewest votes
is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed to the remaining
candidates based on the next preferences. This process repeats until a
candidate receives a majority, ensuring that the winner reflects the
preferences of a broader range of voters.

## How IRV Counts Work

In Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) elections, voters rank candidates in
order of preference. Initially, each candidate receives the votes
where they are ranked first. The candidate with the least votes is
eliminated, and their votes are transferred to the next preferred
candidate on each ballot. This elimination process continues until one
candidate has a majority and is declared the winner.

## Example

Suppose there are 4 candidates: Alice, Bob, Chuan, and Diego. The
votes are as follows:

<div className="flex justify-center mb-8">
  <Image

    alt="Preferences and Counts Table"
    width={250}
    height={180}
    className="rounded-md"
  />
</div>

We first count the first preference tallies: Alice has 5 votes, Bob
has 2, Chuan has 4, and Diego has 4. This means that Bob is eliminated
first and his votes are distributed to the next-preferred candidate on
each ballot—Diego gets the (B, D, A) vote and Alice gets the (B, A, C)
vote. The new tallies are Alice: 6, Bob: eliminated, Chuan: 4, Diego: 5. Now Chuan is eliminated. Diego gains two more votes—the (C, D)
ballots—and wins with 7 votes compared to Alice’s 6.
