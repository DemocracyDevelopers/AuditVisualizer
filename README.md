# Getting Started

1. git clone repository

## frontend

1. run `nvm use` to initialize the right node version for the frontend development environment
   1. if you don't have nvm, you need to install it
      - windows
        - https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows
      - linux/macos
        - https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
   2. nvm allows you to quickly install and use different versions of node via the command line
2. run `pnpm i` to install all the dependency for the frontend development environment
   1. if you don't have pnpm, you may need to install it
      - run `npm install -g pnpm` in terminal or following the official tutorial https://pnpm.io/installation
      - pnpm is a node module manager better than npm
3. run `pnpm dev`
